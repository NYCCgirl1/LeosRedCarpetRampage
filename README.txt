The player is Leonardo DiCaprio on the red carpet. The goal of the game is to catch the Oscar (which is daggling just out of reach), grab some other awards on the way , and stand up against all of the obstacles standing in the way. 

Obstacles include: 
 - jumping over/on paparazzi
 - not crashing into hot models [models are different from paparazzi because 1) you lose points if you jump on them and 2) they aren't stationary - they walk the carpet too]

Win condition: Pass the three levels of being a great actor (Poise, Popularity, Persona)
Lose condition: Lose all three "P"s - yes, that means you cannot mess up on the first round

The gameplay:
	-LEVEL 1: Start with one life [persona]. avoid the paps for 30ish seconds. Jump on them if you want.
	-LEVEL 2: [gain a life cause you conquered "poise"]
			  Now there are fans and paps. Avoid both but dont touch the fans or you'll lose a life. Also, fans move.
			  Survive for 30ish seconds as well.
	-LEVEL 3: [gain a life cause you conquered "personality"]
			  Same rules and people as before but now you have to get awards. Get 25 awards to win! 
Controls: 
	Hit A to jump.
	Hit the left and right arrow keys to speed up (go right) and slow down (go left)
	The cheat (Hit START and B at once) is the "save the planet" sign and the paps/fans have no effect on you.
